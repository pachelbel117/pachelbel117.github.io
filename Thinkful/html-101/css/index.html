    <p>Hey I’m also a block level element which means i get a row all to myself in my parent container. My parent here is 300px wide, which means that i will be 300px wide. I will be as wide as my parent.</p>
    <p>Hey check it out. Just another block level element here, but this time I’m going to show you <span>some inline elements</span> like <em>this</em> and <a href=”the-internetz.com”>this</a> and <strong>this</strong>.</p>
